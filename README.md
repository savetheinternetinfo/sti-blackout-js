## :pushpin: What is this?

This is an Embed-ready script for the SaveTheInternet blackout. <br>
Demo: [https://savetheinternetinfo.github.io/blackout/](https://savetheinternetinfo.github.io/blackout/)

<hr>

## :question: What's the blackout all about? 

In protest against Article 13 (uploadfilters) and Article 11 (link tax) of the currently much discussed copyright directive, we encourage you to display nothing but a blackout page on the 21st of March. Even the german wikipedia will display a blackout page!

## :wrench: How do I use it?

You can either use the versions inside the repository here and upload it your server, or use this snippet here and include it in the `<head>` section of your website:

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://static.savetheinternet.info/js/blackout.min.js"></script>
```

**Note:** If you use wordpress, you can use our plugin: https://github.com/savetheinternetinfo/sti-blackout-wordpress

> _In case you are wondering what the string thing on [line 7](https://github.com/savetheinternetinfo/sti-blackout-js/blob/master/blackout.js#L7) is: <br>
> Thats the uri encoded version of the [blackout HTML script](https://github.com/savetheinternetinfo/blackout/blob/master/index.html) which gets injected into the fullscreen iFrame._
